# Notification Bar
A [notification](http://developer.android.com/intl/ru/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/notifications.html) is a message you can display to the user outside of your applicationâ€™s normal UI. When you tell the system to issue a notification, it first appears as an icon in the notification area. To see the details of the notification, the user opens the notification drawer. Both the notification area and the notification drawer are system-controlled areas that the user can view at any time.
<br>
Notifications are used to alert users on some events that requires their attention. Notifications alert the users through various forms:
- Display a status bar icon
- Flash the LED
- Vibrate
- Ringtones

Status bar notifications indicates some ongoing background services such as downloading or playing music or displays an alert/information. To see the notification user needs to open the notification drawer. Notifications are handled by [Notification Manger](http://developer.android.com/intl/ru/reference/android/app/NotificationManager.html) in Android. Notification Manager is a system service used to manage notifications.
